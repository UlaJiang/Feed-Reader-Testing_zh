authorï¼šulajiang

========================== Component =========================

Jasmine/spec/feedreader.js is a test file that tests whether the main function of the web page is working properly

========================== Specific functional test ======================
1. Write a test that loops through each feedback in the allFeeds object and ensures that it has a defined non-null URL.
2. Write a test that loops through each feedback in the allFeeds object and ensures that it has a defined non-empty name.
3. Write a new test suite and name it "The menu".
4. Write tests to ensure that menu elements are hidden by default. It is also required to analyze HTML and CSS to determine how the hidden/displayed menu elements are implemented.
5. Write tests to make sure the menu changes its visibility when the menu is clicked. The test should have two expectations: whether the menu is displayed when clicked, and whether the menu is hidden when clicked again.
6. Write a test suite and name "Initial Entries".
7. Write a test to ensure that at least one .entry element exists in the .feed container after the loadFeed function is called and executed.
8. Write a test suite and name "New Feed Selection."
9. Write tests to ensure that whenever the loadFeed function loads a new feedback, the content changes accordingly.

=========================== Start the test ===========================

Double-click the index.html file, the corresponding web page will appear, and the bottom of the page is the running result of the test script.

=========================== Project Resources ===========================

Feedreader.js is implemented by me, and the rest of the files are provided by Uda College.
